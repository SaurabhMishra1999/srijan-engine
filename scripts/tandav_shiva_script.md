# TANDAV - The Cosmic Dance of Shiva
## Epic Trailer Script

In the beginning, there was only cosmic consciousness.
Before creation, before destruction, before existence itself.
There was only SHIVA - the eternal dancer, the lord of cosmos.

The universe awakens to his presence.
Shiva rises, adorned with serpents and moonlight.
His third eye gleams with infinite knowledge.
His body painted with sacred ash.

The drums begin - the heartbeat of creation.
Damru resonates through the void - creating rhythm from silence.
This is TANDAV, the cosmic dance.

With his first step, mountains tremble.
The earth spins beneath his feet.
He lifts his right leg - creating infinite galaxies.
He raises his left arm - destroying the old and making way for the new.

His hair flows like the Ganges - purifying all existence.
Each movement tells a story of creation and destruction.
Each gesture births new worlds and dissolves ancient empires.
This is the eternal dance - TANDAV.

Faster he spins, his shadow covering all dimensions.
The serpent around his neck dances in rhythm.
Fire emanates from his body - the fire of transformation.
Smoke rises like incense in cosmic temples.

His eyes close in meditation, yet he dances.
His body moves in impossible ways.
Up, down, spinning, swaying - the dance has no beginning, no end.
It is eternal, it is infinite, it is TANDAV.

The world cannot comprehend such power.
Angels watch in awe, asuras flee in fear.
The gods bow their heads as Shiva dances.
This dance is their salvation, their destruction, their truth.

With a final spin, the universe comes to stillness.
His foot touches the ground - reality settles.
The dance ends, but the vibration continues forever.
TANDAV - the cosmic dance, eternal and supreme.

This is the story of creation.
This is the story of the divine.
This is TANDAV - witness the dance of lord Shiva.
